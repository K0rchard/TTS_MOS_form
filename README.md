This is a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) form for speech synthesized with Tacotron 2 acoustic model and HiFi-GAN vocoder. The tacotron 2 model was trained for 500 epochs with batch size of 16 and the dataset length of 2,592 samples (4 hours, 43 minutes total duration of audio, and 6.57 s mean clip duration). A pre-trained LJ-Speech model was used as a starting point for training.
